# Brain Tumor Visual Question Answering (VQA) System

## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and documentation for a Visual Question Answering system that uses deep learning to diagnose brain tumors from MRI scans and answer medical questions. Built using Python, Keras/TensorFlow, and NLP models.

## Features
- MRI brain tumor classification (glioblastoma, meningioma, pituitary adenoma, metastatic tumor)
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for feature extraction
- Transformer/NLP model for question response
- Achieved 97.9% training accuracy, 70.5% test accuracy

## Files
- `brain-tumor-vqa.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with all code (data prep, model definition, training, evaluation)
- `AI-project-report.docx`: Full project report with methodology and results

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository
2. Install Python and required libraries (see notebook for requirements)
3. Open the notebook and run all cells

## Results
- High accuracy in model predictions for medical image questions
